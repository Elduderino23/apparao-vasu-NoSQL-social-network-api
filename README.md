# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Your Task

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Over the last part of this course, you’ll use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it’s important that you understand how to build and structure the API first.

Your challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps.

No seed data is provided, so you’ll need to create your own data using Insomnia after you’ve created your API.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```

## Mock Up

The following animations show examples of the application's API routes being tested in Insomnia.

The following animation shows GET routes to return all users and all thoughts being tested in Insomnia:

The following animation shows GET routes to return a single user and a single thought being tested in Insomnia:

![Demo that shows GET routes to return a single user and a single thought being tested in Insomnia.](./Assets/18-nosql-challenge-demo-02.gif)

The following animation shows the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users being tested in Insomnia:

![Demo that shows the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users being tested in Insomnia.](./Assets/18-nosql-challenge-demo-03.gif)

In addition to this, your walkthrough video should show the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

The following animation shows the POST and DELETE routes for a user’s friend list being tested in Insomnia:

![Demo that shows the POST and DELETE routes for a user’s friend list being tested in Insomnia.](./Assets/18-nosql-challenge-demo-04.gif)

In addition to this, your walkthrough video should show the POST and DELETE routes for reactions to thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

## Getting Started

Be sure to have MongoDB installed on your machine. Follow the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) to install MongoDB locally.

Use the following guidelines to set up your models and API routes:

### Models

**User**:

* `username`
  * String
  * Unique
  * Required
  * Trimmed

* `email`
  * String
  * Required
  * Unique
  * Must match a valid email address (look into Mongoose's matching validation)

* `thoughts`
  * Array of `_id` values referencing the `Thought` model

* `friends`
  * Array of `_id` values referencing the `User` model (self-reference)

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `friendCount` that retrieves the length of the user's `friends` array field on query.

---

**Thought**:

* `thoughtText`
  * String
  * Required
  * Must be between 1 and 280 characters

* `createdAt`
  * Date
  * Set default value to the current timestamp
  * Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

* `username` (The user that created this thought)
  * String
  * Required

* `reactions` (These are like replies)
  * Array of nested documents created with the `reactionSchema`

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `reactionCount` that retrieves the length of the thought's `reactions` array field on query.

---

**Reaction** (SCHEMA ONLY)

* `reactionId`
  * Use Mongoose's ObjectId data type
  * Default value is set to a new ObjectId

* `reactionBody`
  * String
  * Required
  * 280 character maximum

* `username`
  * String
  * Required

* `createdAt`
  * Date
  * Set default value to the current timestamp
  * Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

**Schema Settings**:

This will not be a model, but rather will be used as the `reaction` field's subdocument schema in the `Thought` model.

### API Routes

**`/api/users`**

* `GET` all users

* `GET` a single user by its `_id` and populated thought and friend data

* `POST` a new user:

```json
// example data
{
  "username": "lernantino",
  "email": "lernantino@gmail.com"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a user by its `_id`

* `DELETE` to remove user by its `_id`

**BONUS**: Remove a user's associated thoughts when deleted.

---

**`/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`**

* `POST` to add a new friend to a user's friend list

* `DELETE` to remove a friend from a user's friend list

---

**`/api/thoughts`**

* `GET` to get all thoughts

* `GET` to get a single thought by its `_id`

* `POST` to create a new thought (don't forget to push the created thought's `_id` to the associated user's `thoughts` array field)

```json
// example data
{
  "thoughtText": "Here's a cool thought...",
  "username": "lernantino",
  "userId": "5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a thought by its `_id`

* `DELETE` to remove a thought by its `_id`

---

**`/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions`**

* `POST` to create a reaction stored in a single thought's `reactions` array field

* `DELETE` to pull and remove a reaction by the reaction's `reactionId` value

<!-- # NoSQL: Social Network API

## Deployable Video Link


## Goal
The task was to make a NoSQL Social Media application that passed all routing test on Insomnia.

## Technology Use
  - Javascript
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - Mongoose
  - MongoDB
  - VS Code
  - Git Bash 
  - GitHub

## Execution
The first step when creating the social media application with NoSQL was to create the files associated with MVC but with the added benefit of not having a schema.sql file since MongoDB has the added benefit of being a nonstructural version of MySQL. Instead, the schema would be in the models themselves because MongoDB is that flexible. Schemas for reactions and thoughts were in the Thought model while the schema for the users in the User schema. The schema for users in the User schema:

userSchema code:
```Javascript
const userSchema = new Schema(
  {
    username: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      unique: true,
      trim: true,
    },
    email: {
      type: String, 
      validate: {
        validator: function(v) {
          return /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/.test(v);
        }},

      required: true,
      unique: true,
    },
  thoughts : [
      {type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,ref:'Thought'}
  ],
  friends : [
    {type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,ref:'User'}
  ],
  },
  {
    toJSON: {
      getters: true,
    },
  }
);
userSchema.virtual('friendCount').get(function() {
  return this.friends.length;
});
```
As shown above, the user schema interwoven in the User model so that user routes could utilized both the schema and the model. This would be controlled by the user-controller.js file. The same can be said about the Thought model but with said model there is schemas for thoughts and reaction.

Routes in NoSQL, unlike MySQL, was relatively short and succinct. 

The following code is and example code from user-routes.js:
```Javascript
const router = require('express').Router();
const {
getUser,
getSingleUser,
createUser,
deleteUser,
updateUser,
addFriend,
removeFriend
} = require('../../controllers/user-controller');


router.route('/').get(getUser).post(createUser);


router.route('/:userId').get(getSingleUser).delete(deleteUser).put(updateUser);


router.route('/:userId/friends/:friendId').post(addFriend).delete(removeFriend)
module.exports = router;
```
Each const controls each route in Insomnia like updateUser controls put route test, getUser for get routes etc.

An example of the thought-routes.js of this is the code from category-routes.js is shown below:
```Javascript
const router = require('express').Router();
const { Category, Product } = require('../../models');

// The `/api/categories` endpoint

router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  // find all categories
  try {
    const categoryData = await Category.findAll({
      // Add Product as a second model to JOIN with
      include: [{ model: Product }],
    });
    res.status(200).json(categoryData);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json(err);
  }
  // be sure to include its associated Products
});

router.get('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  // find one category by its `id` value
  try {
    const categoryData = await Category.findByPk(req.params.id, {
      // Add Product as a second model to JOIN with
      include: [{ model: Product }],
    });

    if (!categoryData) {
      res.status(404).json({ message: 'No category found with that id!' });
      return;
    }

    res.status(200).json(categoryData);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json(err);
  }
  // be sure to include its associated Products
});

router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  // create a new category
  try {
    const categoryData = await Category.create(req.body);
    res.status(200).json(categoryData);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).json(err);
  }

});

router.put('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  // update a category by its `id` value
  try {
    const categoryData = await Category.update(
      {
      category_name: req.body.category_name
    },
    {
      where: {
        id: req.params.id,
      },
    }
    )

    res.status(200).json(categoryData);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json(err);
  }
});

router.delete('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  // delete a category by its `id` value
  try {
    const categoryData = await Category.destroy({
      where: {
        id: req.params.id,
      },
    });

    if (!categoryData) {
      res.status(404).json({ message: 'No category found with that id!' });
      return;
    }

    res.status(200).json(categoryData);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json(err);
  }
});

module.exports = router;


```
Async forces the code to work and makes it possible to test on Insomnia. If it works, there is a 200 message that light up. Any other number was an error.  

There was also these two lines of code that had to be filled in so that the server could be ran. The codes are shown below:

```Javascript
const sequelize = require('./config/connection');
```
```Javascript
sequelize.sync({ force: false }).then(() => {
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`App listening on port ${PORT}!`);
})});
 ```
The last part in order to work was to fill out the index.js within the models folder. It was the glue that connects the models to each other and essential for routes to make it work in the first place. That code is show below:

 ```Javascript
const Product = require('./Product');
const Category = require('./Category');
const Tag = require('./Tag');
const ProductTag = require('./ProductTag');

// Products belongsTo Category
Product.belongsTo(Category, {
  foreignKey: "category_id",
  onDelete: "CASCADE",
});
// Categories have many Products
Category.hasMany(Product, {
  foreignKey: "category_id"
})
// Products belongToMany Tags (through ProductTag)
Product.belongsToMany(Tag, {
  through: ProductTag,
  foreignKey: "product_id"
})
// Tags belongToMany Products (through ProductTag)
Tag.belongsToMany(Product, {
  through: ProductTag,
  foreignKey: "tag_id"
});

module.exports = {
  Product,
  Category,
  Tag,
  ProductTag,
};

```
## Result

The following website demonstrates what the final product looks like:

Get request for category:


Get by id request for category:



Put request for category:


Delete request for category:



Get request for tag:


Get by id request for tag:


Post request for tag:


Put request for tag:


Delete request for tag:



Get request for product:


Get by id request for product:


Post request for product:


Put request for product:


Delete request for product:
